**Lab Descriptions:**

_Lab 1: Binary Search_

This algorithm returns the index at which target should be inserted 
into the array sortedArr in order for the array to remain sorted. If 
the value of target already appears in the array, then it should 
simply return the value of the index at which it appears.

_Lab 2: Kadane's Algorithm_

This lab contains an algorithm that will find the maximum sum 
of a contiguous sub-array within a given array.
